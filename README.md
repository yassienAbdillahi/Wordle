# Wordle

The task for this project was to re-create the [Wordle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

#### User Stories

As someone playing the game, I want to:

* [x] Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name
* [x] Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
* [x] See the rules of the game
* [x] See the 6x5 tile grid; each row representing one of my six available guesses and each tile an individual letter
* [ ] See the keyboard each of which is a clickable button that I can use to guess with
* [ ] See the letters that I am guessing appear in the appropriate tiles
* [ ] Click a button to 'backspace/erase' a letter before I submit my guess
* [ ] Click a button to submit my guess
* [ ] If my guess is not a valid five-letter word, I should receive some kind of feedback
* [ ] See the colour of the grid tiles change after I submit my guess; the letters should all go from black to white but the background colour of each tile should be different according to the correctness of my guess i.e. green if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, beige if it is in the word but in the wrong position and grey if it is not in the word at all.
* [ ] See the colour and background colour of each keyboard letter change to match the info gained from the guess i.e. if I guessed "BRAIN" and the letters "R" and "A" are in the word but in the wrong position, then the background colour of those letters should change to beige on my keyboard
* [ ] At the end get feedback congratulatingme if I won and revealing the correct answer if I didn't
